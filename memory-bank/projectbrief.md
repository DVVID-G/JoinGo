# Project Brief

Project: JoinGo

Purpose: Provide a secure, lightweight backend for small-group videoconferencing with user profiles, meeting creation, realtime signaling, and persistent chat. This document is the single-source foundation for product and technical decisions stored in the memory bank.

Core goals:
- Deliver fast join and minimal friction for participants using Firebase auth.
- Provide meeting creation and basic host controls.
- Persist chat and plan for AI summarization.

Primary stakeholders: Students, instructors, small teams needing quick meetings.

Success metrics:
- Health endpoint responds within 200ms under dev load.
- Typical join sequence < 3 round trips before entering a room.
- Chat persistence and summary pipeline functional for closed meetings.

Notes: Fill this file with any project-scoped decisions that should guide all subsequent memory-bank files.
